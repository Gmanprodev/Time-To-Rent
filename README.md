### Minimum Viable Product

All the User Stories have been assessed against value and complexity. Due to the relatively short time for the implementation of the website, only the MVPs will be implemented in the first release.


### Design

#### Colors

Following colours have been used:
* ![#222](https://place-hold.it/20/222/000000?text=+) #222 (Mine Shaft) 
* ![#6c757d](https://place-hold.it/20/6c757d/000000?text=+) #6c757d (Pompeii Ash) 
* ![#aab7c4](https://place-hold.it/20/aab7c4/000000?text=+) #aab7c4 (Cadet Blue) 
* ![#000](https://place-hold.it/20/000/000000?text=+) #000 (Black)    
* ![#212529](https://place-hold.it/20/212529/000000?text=+) #212529 (Blue Charcoal) 
* ![#555](https://place-hold.it/20/555/000000?text=+) #555 (Davy's Grey) 
* ![#fff](https://place-hold.it/20/fff/000000?text=+) #fff (White)
* ![#17a2b8](https://place-hold.it/20/17a2b8/000000?text=+) #17a2b8 (Cyan Blue) 


#### Font

The Font I used for this project is **Lato** with the font weights: 
* 300
* 400
* 500

The [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail?query=yellow) font was chosen for it's easy readability and it's mechanical appearence.

### Wireframes

I decided that it would be more helpful to have mockups than simple wireframes. The mockups were built in [figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

Link to the mockups can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/fkOYNcpb1G4whUHj7TskjS/Renovate.IT?node-id=0%3A1). The mockups were designed for the mobile first approach. I have produced a desktop, tablet and mobile mockup of the main pages.

If you are unable to access the mockup links above please see the mockup images [here](https://github.com/Gmanprodev/Renovate-it/tree/master/documentation/wireframes).

    * Customised pages to fit in with the rest of the website.


### Features left to implement

* **Product Ratings** - The site currently shows ratings for each product, however this is hard wired into the database and cannot be changed by the users. For the next release I would like to create the functionality so that users can score each watch with a rating which displays in real time.
* **Tracking User Behaviour** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to view user behaviour.
* **Most and Least Visited Pages on the Site** - Use an analytics tool such as [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) to understand where the traffic is going on the site.


### Bugs and Fixes for Future Releases After Testing
 
* **Image Size and Hosting** - The Lighthouse Audit Report will show better performance.
* **Social Media Links in Footer** - The social media icons are linked to the correct pages, however these are currently generic login pages. These will direct you to the company specific pages in future releases. They could also do with more space between the icons.
